# Magic-Square-of-Squares

This code was written to find a smaller "magic square of squares" than the one of Allen William Johnson, as given in a [blog post of John D. Cook](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2021/04/20/magic-square-of-squares/). 

In initial testing, the results were not great. Due to the nature of magic squares, there is [a lot of symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square#Transformations_that_preserve_the_magic_property), and none of it is being exploited in my initial code.
